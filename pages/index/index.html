        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>
            With this page we wanted to create a Chrome extension that helps with
            tracking your study sessions, as well as keep you focused if you stray to any non-productive sites.
            You can manage how long you study and what pages to block, and win a cute companion with every session.
            And in the end, you will have built your very own Zoo!

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <h3> Timer and Statistics </h3>
        <p>
            Start a study session by choosing a timer, which then alerts you as soon as you finished
            your chosen session, along with the achieved animal. These animals are recorded on the
            Statistics page, which in turn also records your study sessions.
        </p>
        <h3> Blocked Websites </h3>
        <p>
            Blocked Pages are ones that hinder your studying, like Social Media. A few are already blocked
            by us, but you can modify the list to fit your needs.
